This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, make sure to install dependencies:

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Users can use the searchbar to find their city, or click on the location icon to use local geolocation data from the browser. 

This project was made as part of a course from myFreeCodeCamp teaching Nextjs, TypeScript, React, and TailwindCSS.
